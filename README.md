# SuperAutoPets-Bot
This is a bot that can play the game "Super Auto Pets" by Team Wood Games.
The bot is for educational purposes only.
    It works by reading the images on the screen, and assigning a utility score to its possible decisions, and choosing the best one
for the current situation.
This is a work in progress. 


If you're going to attempt to use this, be warned I haven't tested it on other systems. 

Standard Pack only
I used the snowfield background to create the recognition models...I'll see about updating this to the default. 
Fast Forward Factor set to 200%


Known bugs:
Item particle effects cause pet recognition to fail
